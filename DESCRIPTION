Description: Causal and statistical inference on a nonparametric treatment
    effect curve requires care in both estimation and inference.  This
    package, implements the Method of Direct Estimation and Inference.
    The method takes an outcome, variable of theoretical interest
    (treatment), and set of covariates and then returns a partial
    derivative (marginal effect) of the treatment variable at each point
    along with uncertainty intervals. The approach offers two advances.
    First, a split-sample approach is used as a guard against overfitting.
    Second, the method uses a data-driven interval derived from conformal
    inference, rather than relying on a normality assumption on the error
    terms.
