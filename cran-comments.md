* This is a new release.
* I submitted once before back in October. I have made the following changes: adding a citation to the paper properly, changing a dontrun to a donttest, placing the name of the package MDEI in quotes in the description, ie 'MDEI'
* This file (cran-comments.md) is triggering a note. It is in my Rbuildignore.  I will delete it if I need to.
