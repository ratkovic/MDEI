* This is a new release.
* I have submitted several times.  As per your comments, I have added a citation to the DESCRIPTION file using the form requested.
* The output being printed directly to the console is only giving progress of the algorithm, there is no information in this that would be useful to the researcher. It is useful for gauging how long it is taking.  As per your request, I have put this after an option for "verbose."  
* The typo!! Gah. Embarrassed.  Sorry. I fixed this.
