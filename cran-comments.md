* This is a new release.
* I submitted once before back in October. I have made the following changes: adding a citation to the paper properly, changing a dontrun to a donttest, placing the name of the package MDEI in quotes in the description, ie 'MDEI'.  I have cleaned up the DESCRIPTION to pass without notes.
* Spelling errors are in a url or author names.
* This file (cran-comments.md) is triggering a note. It is in my Rbuildignore.  I will delete it if I need to.
